<h1>Postmortem: The XAMPP Port Configuration Outage</h1>
<h3>Issue Summary</h3>

<p>Impact: The Linkin database and web server experienced a complete outage due to a port configuration issue with XAMPP.
Root Cause: The web server failed to listen on the configured port, leading to a failure in establishing connections.</p>
<h3>Timeline</h3>
Issue Detected: Upon routine checks, I noticed the database and web server were inaccessible.
Investigation Begins: Initially, I focused on the database server, assuming the issue was related to the database itself.
Misleading Paths: Misleading investigation paths led to checking the web server configuration, assuming the issue was with the web server.
Root Cause Identified: Upon reviewing the XAMPP configuration, I identified the misconfiguration in the MySQL port settings.
Resolution: Corrected the MySQL port settings in XAMPP and restarted the database and web server services.
<h3>Root Cause and Resolution</h3>
The root cause of the outage was a misconfiguration in the MySQL port settings within XAMPP. The default port for MySQL in XAMPP was set to 3307, which was not the expected port for the database connection. This led to the complete failure of the Linkin database and web server, as the web server relies on the database for all operations.

The resolution involved correcting the MySQL port settings in XAMPP to the expected port (3306) and restarting the database and web server services. This restored the connection between the web server and the database, resolving the outage.

<h3>Corrective and Preventative Measures</h3>
Review XAMPP Configuration: Regularly review and test XAMPP configuration settings, especially MySQL port settings, to ensure they are correct and can handle the expected load.
Implement Automated Testing: Add automated tests to the CI/CD pipeline to detect configuration issues during development.
Enhance Monitoring: Increase monitoring for database connection metrics, implementing automated alerts for abnormal patterns.
Documentation and Training: Improve documentation on XAMPP configuration settings and configurations for future troubleshooting. Conduct personal training sessions on identifying and addressing misconfigurations promptly.
This postmortem serves as a critical reflection on the importance of meticulous attention to detail, especially in configuration settings, and the need for proactive measures to prevent similar incidents in the future.
